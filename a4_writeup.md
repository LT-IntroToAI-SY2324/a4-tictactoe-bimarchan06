# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The most difficult part of the tic-tac-toe was understanding the algorithm of how to input for the positions worked. I was confused at first on how the coding worked but when you showed us the visual on paper I understood it better. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

I would add a computer player instead of having a second player as it would take its place in the game.


3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would program the computer player to know the 8 possible combinations to win the game. First I would make sure the computer player is aware of the placements that the opponent player made by programing it to track the moves that the opponents has made. From there I would program the computer player to understand the positions that are left and have the program understand the positions so that they know which positions could win them the game.
